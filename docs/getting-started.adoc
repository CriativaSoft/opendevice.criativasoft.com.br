== Introduction

NOTE: DRAFT: This document is under construction and may change over time. Last Update : {docdate}

OpenDevice is a set of tools and APIs to build solutions for the "Internet of Things". The main objective is to facilitate communication 
between software and hardware locally or in cloud through OpenDevice-API (*under construction*). + 
If your project does not need to communicate with an external software the OpenDevice will not serve for you!.

The OpenDevice APIs enables you to prototype interactive connected products quickly and easily.

Our link:/docs/download/#developer-components-and-plugins[libraries] make integrating with OpenDevice API more easy, letting you write code for your devices, applications, and services with easy integration. All libraries are Open Source and hosted on Github, so that you can use, contribute, and request features on them freely.

You can communicate with OpenDevice Middleware (Cloud and Local Services) using a variety of protocols via:
====
 * HTTP (REST)
 * Sockets/Websocket
 * MQTT (In progress)
====
You can communicate with link:docs/#supported-devices[devices] using a variety of protocols via:
====
 * USB
 * Ethernet
 * WiFi
 * Bluetooth 
====


== Overview

image::overview.png[]

* *Devices*: Is an abstraction of a physical device, which may be a lamp, socket, sensor, robot, or even a logical device. These devices are managed and controlled by a hardware like Arduino, Raspberry and others (link:docs/#supported-devices[see list]) or can be built in an embedded own equipment, this is the proposal of the internet of things. Communication with other components of the platform is done using a binary protocol that is implemented in {repo}/OpenDeviceFirmware[firmware^] written in "C / C ++" and can be ported to other platforms.

* *Binary Protocol*: Used in communication between Device and Middleware/Clients. Can be: 
** Usb, Ethernet, Wifi, Bluetooth 
* *Clients*: Any device that can make HTTP requests: PC, Mobile, Tablet or any device with a browser. According to the "client" you will 
decide which API to be used. More details are explained in the session: Components > Clients APIs

* *Clients Protocol*: Rest API, WebSocket API. (Using JSON)
* *Local Server (Middleware)*: Any computer running JVM: PC, Raspberry, Android(not tested)

TIP: To simplify the documentation and images the term DEVICE will represent the Arduino / Similar

== Requirements

Before using OpenDevice you will need as a minimum a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed version 1.6 or above. Download the appropriate JDK for your operating system, run the installer, and then set up an environment variable called *JAVA_HOME* pointing to the location of this installation.

 * Linux, Windows, MacOS
 * http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/pt/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Java Development Kit (JDK)^] (installed version 1.6 or above) 
 * http://www.javatalk.org/2013/11/BEST-JAVA-IDE.html[Java IDE^] (any one of your choice - if you plan compile the java examples)
 * http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html[Android SDK^] (if you plan compile the android examples)
 * Choose the Toolchain/IDE for the Specific hardware platform, example:
 ** http://arduino.cc/en/main/software[Arduino IDE^]
 ** http://energia.nu/download/[Energia IDE^]

TIP: It is recommended that you have basic knowledge of Java and Arduino.

IMPORTANT: The core development has been done in Linux, you can see some bugs in other platforms, please help to do testing in another platform

== Installation

The Client APIs are managed by maven. Most IDEs have with native support for maven, you no need to install it manually. + 
Create a link:#maven-tutorial[new maven project] using the IDE and add this configuration:

[source, xml]
.Dependency declaration in Maven's pom.xml
----
<dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>br.com.criativasoft.opendevice</groupId>
            <artifactId>opendevice-core</artifactId> <!--1-->
            <version>[0.1.2-SNAPSHOT,)</version> <!--2-->
        </dependency>
</dependencies>
----
<1> Put the name of the component you need
<2> Find in {maven-repo-ref}[maven central] last version


[source, groovy]
.Dependency declaration in Gradle's build.gradle
----
dependencies {
  compile('br.com.criativasoft.opendevice:opendevice-core:${opendevice.version}') { <!--1-->
    transitive = false
  }
}
----
<1> Find in {maven-repo-ref}[maven central] last version and change ${opendevice.version}

=== Maven Tutorial:

If you are new to maven these tutorials can help you:

== Get Sources

The source code is hosted on Github, you need http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[install git^]. Some IDEs comes with it installed.
Alternatively you can https://github.com/CriativaSoft/OpenDevice/archive/master.zip[download directly], it is more practical but would not recommend it because you can not get the updates.

Clone OpenDevice repository::
----
git clone https://github.com/CriativaSoft/OpenDevice --depth 1 --depth 1
----

Find folders::
 * OpenDevice/opendevice-samples
 * OpenDevice/opendevice-connection/opendevice-connection-samples (low-level samples)

IMPORTANT: In the examples of the arduino documentation will be used for demonstration, but not be limited to it.

// include::sample-blink-low-level.adoc[]
