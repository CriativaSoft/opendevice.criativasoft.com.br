== What is OpenDevice?

OpenDevice is a set of tools and APIs to build solutions for the *"Internet of Things"* like home automations systems, robotics, smart city, energy monitoring, security, sensor monitoring. +
Provide an open and unified framework to interconnect IoT devices, data, and applications over the Web,
if you need communication between software and hardware, probably your place is here.

The main objective is monitor and control inexpensive hardwares like Arduino, RaspberryPI and link:docs/#supported-devices[similar platforms], local(offline) or over the cloud using high-level programing languages and with abstraction of protocols and low-level details.

This allows you to focus on your project and innovation, leave obscure details of communication protocols and specifications with OpenDevice, you will make a major step towards the success of your project.

TIP: Plug your device (Arduino/Raspberypi/Other) to the Cloud and sync in real-time

=== Features

* TODO !!!!!!!!!!!!!

== Components

image::component-middleware.png[]

The middleware is the central part of the platform and is composed with a set of {repo}/opendevice-servers[servers^] that make the abstraction of link:docs/protocols[communication protocols]  used between the components of hardware and software. It's possible to control an Arduino or similar using any high-level programming language through the link:docs/rest-api[REST API] for example. +
The middleware can run both locally and in the cloud and is compatible with any operating system that can run java (windows, linux, mac, and possibly a tabllet running android)

image::component-clients.png[]

APIs used to connect with the Middleware (or directly with the hardware) using link:docs/protocols[protocols] like Rest and WebSocket, some examples are: {repo}/[JavaScript API^], {repo}/opendevice-clients[Java API^], {repo}/opendevice-clients/opendevice-wasync-client[Android API^]. + 
They make your life very easy by abstracting low-level details.
You can communicate directly with the device without using the middleware using the binary protocol and with the help of the library {repo}/opendevice-connection/opendevice-connection-stream[opendevice-connection-stream^] (for USB, Bluetooth, Ethernet, Wifi) + 
See the link:/docs/#samples[examples] for how to use these libraries to control devices.

image::component-firmware.png[]

This component is used in the arduino (and link:docs/#supported-devices[similars]) and has various facilities for working with sensors and actuators in some cases avoiding manual programming. +
Also implements the link:docs/binary-protocol[binary communication protocol] with Middleware or another device.

== Overview

TODO: falar do modelo PUB-SUB e programação baseada em eventos, poderia ter um exemplo simples ??


=== Getting Started and Samples

For details of how to develop using OpenDevice, recommend reading the documentation specific to each component (the links pointing in the downloads section) and check the sample projects. However you can start with a more general guide

* link:docs/getting-started[Getting Started]
* link:docs[Documentation]
* link:docs/#samples[Samples]

== Contributing

In the spirit of {freesoftware}[free software], 'everyone' is encouraged to
help improve this project.
Here are some ways *you* can contribute:
 using beta versions, reporting bugs, writing documentation, writing code...

==== Submitting an Issue

We use the {issues}[GitHub issue tracker] associated with this project
to track bugs and features. Before submitting a bug report or feature
request, check to make sure it hasn't already been submitted. 

==== Submitting a Pull Request

When performing any fix or implement a new feature feel free to make a {pr}[pull request], so you need to create a {fork}[fork of the repository].
