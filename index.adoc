== What is OpenDevice?

OpenDevice is a set of tools and APIs to build solutions for the *"Internet of Things"* like home automations systems, robotics, smart city, energy monitoring, security, sensor monitoring. +
Provide an open and unified framework to interconnect IoT devices, data, and applications over the Web,
if you need communication between software and hardware, probably your place is here.

The main objective is monitor and control inexpensive hardwares like Arduino, RaspberryPI and {docs}/Documentation#Documentation-SupportedDevices[similar platforms], local(offline) or over the cloud using high-level programing languages and with abstraction of protocols and low-level details.

This allows you to focus on your project and innovation, leave obscure details of communication protocols and specifications with OpenDevice, you will make a major step towards the success of your project.

TIP: Plug your device (Arduino/Raspberypi/Other) to the Cloud and sync in real-time.

== Technology

=== Features

 * Open API (for: REST, JavaScript, Java, Android, Arduino, EnergiaIDE)
 * Cloud Connector
 * Real-time (WebSockets)
 * Event-Based
 * Async & non-blocking
 * Multi-protocol support (Usb, Bluetooth, TCP)
 * Language agnostic
 * Platform Agnostic (Windows, Linux, Mac, MIPs on OpenWRT)
 * Lightweight/Built-in Servers (not need the tomcat or glassfish)


== Components

image::component-middleware.png[]

The middleware is the central part of the platform and is composed with a set of {repo}/opendevice-servers[servers^] that make the abstraction of {docs}/Getting+started#Gettingstarted-Communications&Protocols[communication protocols]  used between the components of hardware and software. It's possible to control an Arduino or similar using any high-level programming language through the {docs}/Rest+API[REST API] for example. +
The middleware can run both locally and in the cloud and is compatible with any operating system that can run java (windows, linux, mac, and possibly a tabllet running android)

image::component-clients.png[]

APIs used to connect with the Middleware (or directly with the hardware) using protocols like Rest and WebSocket, some examples are: {repo}/opendevice-clients/opendevice-js[JavaScript API^], {repo}/opendevice-clients[Java API^], {repo}/opendevice-clients/opendevice-wasync-client[Android API^]. + 
They make your life very easy by abstracting low-level details.
You can communicate directly with the device without using the middleware using the binary protocol and with the help of the library {repo}/opendevice-connection/opendevice-connection-stream[opendevice-connection-stream^] (for USB, Bluetooth, Ethernet, Wifi) + 
See the {docs}/Documentation#Documentation-Tutorials[tutorials and samles] for how to use these libraries to control devices.

image::component-firmware.png[]

This component/library is used in the arduino (and {docs}/Documentation#Documentation-SupportedDevices[similars]) and has various facilities for working with sensors and actuators in some cases avoiding manual programming. +
Also implements the {docs}/Binary+protocol[binary communication protocol] with Middleware or another device. 


== Overview

== Event-driven and Real-Time

You not need consult the information, she comes to you when some data is available. This model is achieved thanks to new technologies like WebSockets. This makes it much easier when programming ..


=== Getting Started and Samples

For details of how to develop using OpenDevice, recommend reading the documentation specific to each component (the links pointing in the downloads section) and check the sample projects. However you can start with a more general guide
